### Conclusion / So What?
+ Now that you have the full power of Git and GitHub at your fingertips, collaborating with other developers is fully within your capabilities. This means you can work on some of the hottest coding projects out there, like Rails or Sinatra, and submit pull requests that could result in your code being incorporated into the code base. And when it comes to applying for coding jobs down the road, employers love to see that you've contributed to open source projects.
